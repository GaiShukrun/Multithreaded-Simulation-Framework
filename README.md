- **Concrete States**: ActiveState, BrokenState, FailedState, and FinishedState implementations
- **State Transitions**: Clean, predictable state changes based on race events

### Observer Pattern Integration
- **GUI Updates**: Real-time interface updates through observer notifications
- **Decoupled Architecture**: Separation of game logic from presentation layer
- **Event-Driven Design**: Responsive user interface with automatic updates

### Arena System
- **Abstract Arena**: Base class defining common racing environment behavior
- **Specialized Arenas**: AerialArena, LandArena, and NavalArena with unique characteristics
- **Racer Validation**: Type checking to ensure compatible racer-arena combinations

### Racer Hierarchy
- **Abstract Racer**: Base class with common racing behavior and state management
- **Specialized Racers**: Type-specific implementations with unique characteristics and capabilities
- **Wheeled Interface**: Additional behavior for vehicles with wheel-based mechanics

## Development Features

### Object-Oriented Design
- **Inheritance Hierarchies**: Well-structured class relationships with proper abstraction
