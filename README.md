## Project Overview

This project is a multithreaded racing simulation built in Java. It uses a Swing GUI to visualize a race where multiple racers compete in different types of arenas. The core of the project demonstrates the practical application of several key software engineering concepts.

### Core Concepts Implemented

Here is a breakdown of the specific programming concepts and design patterns used in this project:

#### 1. State Design Pattern

This pattern is used to manage the changing condition of a `Racer` during the race.

-   **`RacerState` Interface**: Defines the common contract for all states.
-   **Concrete States**: You have implemented four states:
    -   `ActiveState`: For a racer that is currently racing.
    -   `BrokenState`: For a racer that has a temporary mishap.
    -   `FailedState`: For a racer that can no longer continue the race.
    -   `FinishedState`: For a racer that has crossed the finish line.
-   **Context**: The `Racer` class holds a `RacerState` object. The state is changed dynamically within the `RaceRunnable` based on events like mishaps or finishing the race.

#### 2. Concurrency and Multithreading

This is used to make all racers move simultaneously and independently.

-   **`Runnable` and `Thread`**: The `RaceRunnable` class implements `Runnable`, and each racer is executed on its own `Thread`.
-   **Concurrency Control**: You used `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock` to prevent race conditions.
    -   Three separate locks (`l1`, `l2`, `l3`) are used in `RaceRunnable` to protect shared resources during critical operations like calculating finishing place, updating racer state, and calculating movement.

#### 3. Factory Design Pattern (with Reflection)

This pattern is used to create `Arena` and `Racer` objects without hardcoding their class names.

-   **`RaceBuilder` Singleton**: This class acts as the central factory.
-   **Java Reflection**: The factory uses `ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader().loadClass()` and `constructor.newInstance()` to create objects from class name strings passed from the GUI. This makes the system extensible, as new racer or arena types can be added without changing the factory's core logic.

#### 4. Observer Design Pattern

This pattern is used to update the GUI with live race data without creating a direct dependency between the game logic and the UI.

-   **`MyObserver` and `MyObservable`**: You created custom observer/observable interfaces.
-   **Implementation**: The `Arena` is the observable object that maintains a list of observers. The `MainScreen` is the observer. When a racer's data changes in its thread, it calls `arena.notifyObservers()`, which pushes the new data to the GUI to be displayed in the information table.

#### 5. Prototype Design Pattern

This pattern is used to create new `Racer` objects by copying an existing one.

-   **`Cloneable` Interface**: The abstract `Racer` class implements `Cloneable`.
-   **Implementation**: The `MainScreen` provides a feature to "Add From Existing Racer". This works by calling the `clone()` method on a selected racer prototype, creating a new object with the same attributes, which can then be customized (e.g., color) and added to the race.

#### 6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

The project is built on a solid foundation of OOP principles.

-   **Inheritance**: You have created deep inheritance hierarchies for both arenas and racers (e.g., `Racer` -> `LandRacer` -> `Car`).
-   **Polymorphism**: The main simulation loop operates on abstract `Racer` and `Arena` objects, but the specific behavior (like movement or legal racer checks) is determined by the concrete subclasses at runtime.
-   **Abstraction**: `Arena` and `Racer` are abstract classes, defining common behaviors and attributes for all types of arenas and racers.
-   **Encapsulation**: All class properties are private, with access controlled through public getter and setter methods.
